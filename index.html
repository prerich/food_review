                <!--my short review of the place-->
                <div><p> Tsaocaa is a boba shop. I have only been to the Tsaocaa location in Malden
                    ,but I love the fruit teas there and the Oreo Brown Sugar drink. They
                    sell delicous fried chicken. Although, it takes a while for the fried chicken,
                    it is very worth the wait because they make it fresh. The interior inside is 
                    adorable. It is a perfect hangout spot. My only complaint is the Prices
                    are high and due to covid it went higher, but the quality makes it worth it at times.

            <!--my short review-->
            <div><p>New York Pizza is an Italian Pizza place. The subs
                and Zita alfredo is to die for. They add alot of alfredo sauce to the dish.
                Also, the prices are pretty good. I love going here when I want to eat
                good quality food, but not break the bank. I dont eat inside because there is
                AC and the kitchen is next the seating, so it gets very hot. The tables are very
                close together and the lighting is awful. Most of the time I do to go order.

            <!-- my short review-->
            <div><p>I would honestly recommend every item in the menu here. I love
                    the tacos and tortas espically. I always order the Tacos de Pastor.
                    Since, it is a food truck, they make the food right when you order,
                    so its always warm and fresh. The workers are all latinos and make it
                    very authentic food. My only complaint is some plates portions are smaller
                    than I would like and the prices are pretty high. However, a lot of tacos places
                    food places have gone higher due to the price of meat going up.
